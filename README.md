# ICCD20_TriviumBMod

This is an archive of the Trivium cipher created using Vivado 2019.1

Created for use on the Chipwhisperer CW305 Artix FPGA Target (https://rtfm.newae.com/Targets/CW305%20Artix%20FPGA/)

A copy of the synthesized bitstream has been copied from the implementations folder to the root directory (labeled TriviumBit4Attack.bit) for your convenience.
